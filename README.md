# Projects with Ubuntu

This repository contains various Ubuntu-based projects that I worked on over the summer. These assignments were based on concepts learned from the textbook:

**Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces**  
*Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau*  
*Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau*  
University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison

Below is a brief description of each project:

## Project 1: File Reversal Program

This program reads a text file, reverses the order of its lines, and then either displays the reversed content on the screen or writes it to a specified output file.

## Project 2: Basic Shell Implementation

This project implements a simple shell that can execute commands. It supports background execution of commands and handles basic built-in commands such as `exit`.

## Project 3: Round Robin Scheduler in C

This program implements a Round Robin scheduler in C. The scheduler processes a list of tasks, each with a burst time, and simulates their execution with a specified time slice. It prints the completion time for each process.

## Project 4.1: Producer-Consumer Model

This project simulates a producer-consumer scenario using a master-worker threading model. Master threads produce integers into a shared buffer, while worker threads consume these integers.
